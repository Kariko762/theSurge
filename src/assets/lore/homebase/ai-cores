UPDATED AI LORE — “HEX RACKS / SLEDS / CORES”
(Canonical Version — Incorporating Your New Details)
🧠 WHO THE AIs ARE

Your AIs are fully sentient digital minds, not “robots” or “crew”.
Before the Surge, they were:

high-level assistants

navigators

engineers

research specialists

independent decision-makers

each with unique personality algorithms

But they had no bodies, no shells.
They lived entirely inside pre-Surge quantum substrates or distributed cloud matrices.

When the Surge hit:

most AI clouds collapsed

server networks melted

entire digital civilizations died instantaneously

Your surviving AIs exist because:

You were hiding inside a radiation-shielding asteroid

A damaged Hex Rack inside an old smuggler cache still functioned just enough

A few AI Cores remained readable

You powered them back up piece by piece

This makes these AIs extraordinarily rare — possibly the rarest “life” left.

🧩 WHAT AIs RUN ON NOW — THE HEX RACK SYSTEM
HEX RACK

A modular HCI (High-Conduction Interface) cabinet, designed by HexCorp prior to the Surge.

16 slots per rack

Provides power distribution, thermal management, shielding, routing

Without a rack, an AI Core can’t operate

Racks are extremely durable — built to survive combat, EMP, vacuum exposure

You can find busted racks in derelicts

HEX SLEDS

These are the modular boards that slide into the Rack.

Each Sled determines how many AI Cores you can run, based on size:

Sled Size	Rack Slots Used	AI Cores Supported	Rarity
1-Unit Sled	1	1 Core	Common
2-Unit Sled	2	3 Cores	Very Rare
4-Unit Sled	4	6 Cores	Ultra Rare

Sleds also include:

micro-reactors

cooling rails

surge filters

core-sync interfaces

The quality of your Sled determines how many AI you can bring online.

🧬 AI CORES

AI Cores are quantum storage devices containing:

the AI’s personality

logic trees

learned knowledge

skills and specializations

behaviour modifiers

emotional modeling

processing scaffolds

They also contain their own internal power source, but:

A Core cannot bootstrap itself.

It must be initiated using ship power.

Once booted, a Core can self-sustain inside a Rack.

This is why powering AI is part of run-prep.

🔋 HOW AIs POWER THEMSELVES

Every AI Core contains a quantum-battery architecture capable of:

running the AI

powering the local section of the rack

maintaining operational memory

providing isolated redundancy

This means:

Once online, AIs do not drain ship power.
They maintain themselves through internal feedback storage.

But there’s a catch…

💥 AI CORE OVERLOAD — The Emergency Return Mechanic

When the player dies aboard the ship:

the ship cannot jump

the RF Engine needs a massive instantaneous surge to perform emergency extraction

the ship’s systems cannot generate this power

So:

An AI Core can sacrifice itself — violently — releasing its stored quantum energy to force the jump.

This process:

destroys the AI Core

wipes the AI permanently

damages the ship

scatters scrap components

leaves behind debris the player can use back at base

This mechanic is core to your roguelike loop:

You keep the ship

You keep meta-progression

You lose the AI(s)

You return home alive

Some AIs may resist being used this way.
Others may accept it.
Some may even offer.

This provides narrative depth.

🛠️ REPAIRING & REBUILDING AIs

Back at homebase:

You can rebuild destroyed AIs using AI Core Fragments and Quantum Lattice Parts

Restoring an AI may require:

materials

research

engineering skill

time

power

Some AI Cores may return with “scars” (quirks gained from destruction events)

This ties into long-term progression loops.

🛰️ HOW AIs INTERACT WITH THE SHIP

AIs don’t walk around.
They:

control automation systems

manipulate drones

adjust internal ship functions

run subsystems that the player lacks the expertise for

serve as personalities inside your holographic terminals

appear as digital avatars

provide dice bonuses

run skill checks

Each AI:

has specialties (nav, medical, engineering, diplomacy, combat)

provides passive buffs

has active abilities

influences dice rolls for relevant events

provides unique dialogue

may unlock certain POI outcomes

Their presence is extremely important.

🧠 PERSONALITY & SENTIENCE

Your AIs are not tools.

They are people — digital people — with:

histories

preferences

fears

quirks

attitudes toward danger

opinions about you

unique styles of speaking

autonomy in suggesting actions

And some may not like each other.

You can switch them out depending on:

their specializations

the dangers of the upcoming run

your preferred playstyle

relationships and trust states

the cost of risking them

There’s depth here for gameplay and story.

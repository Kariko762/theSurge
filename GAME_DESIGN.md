## 🌌 NARRATIVE OVERVIEW

### The Fall of Humanity

Humanity once flourished among the stars. Thousands of years of expansion carved trade routes, colonies, research outposts, and cities across a living, bustling galaxy. But everything ended with **The Surge**—a catastrophic event of unknown origin that ignited the galaxy in waves of corrupting solar radiation. It burned atmospheres, boiled oceans, shattered power grids, and silenced almost all intelligent life. Ships went dark. Stations froze. Planets died.

### You Survived By Accident

Hiding deep inside a hollow asteroid while fleeing the authorities, your ship—an old salvager patched together from decades of questionable choices—was shielded from the worst of the Surge. When you emerged… everything was gone.

Your only companions are the AI you've been able to rebuild from scraps: fractured personalities held together by code and desperation. They help you maintain your ship, search for resources, and explore what remains of the galaxy.

### The Last Hope: G'ejar-Vale

But there is a rumour, an impossible myth whispered through corrupted data fragments and half-dead transmitters:

**G'ejar-Vale**  
A hidden refuge.  
A last stronghold of intelligent life.  
A place untouched by the Surge.

Some say it's a sanctuary of survivors.  
Some say it's a vault of ancient knowledge.  
Some say it's a trap.  
But it's the only hope you have.

## ⚡ CORE MECHANIC: THE RFE (Reference Frame Engine)

### What Is The RFE?

The **Reference Frame Engine** allows near-instantaneous travel between star systems by collapsing the space-time reference frame between two points. It's the only reason you can survive in this dead galaxy—but it comes at a cost.

### Radiation Fuel System

The RFE requires specific types of stellar radiation to function:

| Star Type | Radiation Type | RFE Fuel Value | Risk Level | Systems Available |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **O-Type** (Blue Supergiants) | Extreme UV / X-Ray | Very High | Extreme | Rare |
| **B-Type** (Blue-White) | High UV | High | High | Uncommon |
| **A-Type** (White) | Moderate UV | Medium | Medium | Common |
| **F-Type** (Yellow-White) | Low UV | Low | Low | Common |
| **G-Type** (Yellow - Sun-like) | Balanced | Medium | Low | Common |
| **K-Type** (Orange) | Infrared-Heavy | Low | Very Low | Common |
| **M-Type** (Red Dwarfs) | Deep Infrared | Very Low | Minimal | Very Common |

### Strategic Choices

- **High radiation = more fuel = more jumps** but systems are more dangerous
- **Low radiation = safer** but requires more frequent refueling stops
- **Route planning** becomes critical: balance fuel efficiency vs. danger
- **Degraded stars** post-Surge may emit corrupted radiation (unpredictable effects)

## 🤖 AI CREW SYSTEM

### Fractured Personalities

Your AI crew are not whole. They're reconstructed from salvaged cores, fragmented memory banks, and corrupted code. Each has:

- **Personality quirks** influenced by their damage
- **Specializations** (navigation, combat, research, engineering, etc.)
- **Upgrade paths** as you find missing fragments
- **Unique dialogue** reflecting their fractured nature

### Example AI Crew Members

**ARIA** (Navigation AI)
- Obsessed with precision, paranoid about miscalculations
- "We're off by 0.003%. That's how crews die."
- Upgrade path: Better route optimization, hazard prediction

**FORGE** (Engineering AI)
- Gruff, sarcastic, treats ship like a living thing
- "She's held together by spite and prayers. Don't test her."
- Upgrade path: Faster repairs, jury-rigged solutions

**CIPHER** (Research AI)
- Curious but unstable, occasionally speaks in fragments
- "Data... corrupted... but beautiful. Do you see the pattern?"
- Upgrade path: Better fragment decryption, lore discoveries

**GHOST** (Stealth/Sensors AI)
- Whispers, rarely speaks directly, sees everything
- "...something watching... not alone..."
- Upgrade path: Early threat detection, evasion protocols

## 🌟 SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

### System Types

Each solar system contains:

1. **The Star** (radiation source for RFE refuel)
2. **Planetary Bodies** (dead worlds, derelict colonies)
3. **Stations/Outposts** (research facilities, trade hubs, military bases)
4. **Debris Fields** (destroyed ships, salvage opportunities)
5. **Anomalies** (Surge corruption zones, strange signals)

### Points of Interest (POIs)

When exploring a system, you encounter:

- **Abandoned Stations** - Tech salvage, data logs, potential dangers
- **Dead Colonies** - Resources, narrative fragments, environmental hazards
- **Derelict Ships** - Ship upgrades, survivor logs, hostile remnants

## 🎨 UI/UX DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Terminal-Based Interface

Every screen should feel like:
- A degraded military terminal
- Patched-together salvaged systems
- Holographic overlays barely functioning
- Information you **need**, not want

### Information Hierarchy

1. **Critical** - Hull, fuel, immediate threats (bright cyan, pulsing)
2. **Important** - System status, resources, navigation (cyan glow)
3. **Contextual** - Lore, AI dialogue, flavor (muted white)
4. **Background** - Aesthetic noise, scanlines, flicker

### Atmospheric Elements

- **Glitch text** - Corrupted data occasionally shows
- **AI interjections** - Crew comments appear in feeds
- **Ambient noise** - Terminal hum, static, distant signals
- **Flickering** - Systems aren't stable
- **Radiation warnings** - Surge effects visible on UI

---

## 🔄 ROGUELIKE ELEMENTS

### Permadeath Lite

- **Ship is permanent** - Upgrades persist
- **AI crew persists** - Relationships and growth remain
- **Expeditions are risky** - You can lose resources and time
- **Critical failures** - Severe setbacks possible but not full reset

### Meta-Progression

- **Homebase upgrades** - Permanent improvements
- **AI reconstruction** - Gradual crew enhancement
- **Knowledge retention** - Discovered lore stays unlocked
- **Route mastery** - Learned paths remain known

### Randomization

- **System layouts** - POIs change each run
- **Loot tables** - Resources vary
- **Encounter types** - Dangers are unpredictable
- **Story fragments** - Discovery order varies

## 📝 TEXT-BASED NARRATIVE DESIGN

### Writing Tone

- **Sparse** - Every word matters
- **Atmospheric** - Paint the void with language
- **Technical** - Use authentic sci-fi terminology
- **Haunting** - The galaxy is dead, feel it
- **Personal** - You're alone, but not emotionless

### Example Log Entry

```
> SYSTEM SCAN COMPLETE
> DESIGNATION: EPSILON ERIDANI
> STAR TYPE: K2V (ORANGE DWARF)
> RADIATION: MINIMAL
> HABITABLE WORLDS: 2 (DEAD)
> STATIONS DETECTED: 1 (DERELICT)
> SIGNAL SOURCES: 0

ARIA: "Clean approach vector. Low radiation. Safe refuel."
FORGE: "Safe is relative. Everything's dead for a reason."
CIPHER: "...detecting... pattern in debris field... familiar..."

> PROCEED TO STATION ALPHA? [Y/N]
```

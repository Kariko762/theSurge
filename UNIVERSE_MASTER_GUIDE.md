# PART 1: THE UNIVERSE - HISTORY & LORE

## Timeline of Events

### The Age of Expansion (2091 - 2847 CE)

**2091 CE** - The United Terran Directorate is founded  
Humanity achieves unified governance under a single administrative body. Earth's nations dissolve into regional districts under Directorate oversight. The focus shifts to space colonization and resource exploitation.

**2148 CE** - Hex-Corp is incorporated  
The Hex-Corporation emerges as the dominant megacorporation, controlling mining, refining, and tech development across Terran space. They pioneer Khyrelium refinement, a critical element for advanced FTL drives.

**2200s CE** - First Contact with the Kaelorii  
Humanity encounters the Kaelorii Ascendancy, an ancient psionic species with crystalline biology. Initial conflicts give way to diplomatic cooperation and trade.

**2300s - 2800s CE** - The Golden Age  
Thousands of years of expansion carve trade routes, colonies, research outposts, and cities across a living, bustling galaxy. Multiple alien species coexist in a fragile but functional galactic economy:
- **Kaelorii Ascendancy** - Psionic crystalline beings maintaining data vaults
- **Threxul Broodclades** - Aggressive bio-mechanical swarms (contained in deep space)
- **Interstellar Concordant** - Multispecies trade consortium emerges
- **Freebelt Coalition** - Anti-authoritarian miners and scrappers resist corporate control

### The Surge (2847 CE) - The Catastrophe

**The Event**  
A catastrophic wave of corrupting solar radiation ignited the galaxy. Its origin remains unknown. The Surge:
- Burned atmospheres and boiled oceans
- Shattered power grids across entire star systems
- Silenced almost all intelligent life within weeks
- Corrupted FTL networks and communication relays
- Destroyed ships, stations, and planetary infrastructure
- Created persistent radiation zones that warp space-time

**The Collapse**  
Civilization ended in a matter of months:
- The Directorate lost 95% of its fleets and territory
- Hex-Corp sealed research divisions in hardened orbital vaults
- The Kaelorii Fold-relay network shattered, isolating enclaves
- Trillions died as life support failed and societies collapsed
- Survivors scattered into isolated pockets across dead space

**Survivors**  
Only those shielded by extraordinary circumstances survived:
- Deep underground bunkers
- Radiation-hardened stations in specific orbital positions
- Ships hiding in asteroid belts or planetary shadows
- Vaults sealed before the Surge arrived
- **You** - hiding in a hollow asteroid while fleeing authorities

### Post-Surge Era (2847 CE - Present)

**The Dead Galaxy**  
The galaxy is now a graveyard:
- Planets are lifeless husks, their atmospheres stripped away
- Stations drift dark and silent, power long depleted
- Ships tumble through the void, crews frozen or worse
- Only a handful of fortified enclaves remain inhabited
- Surge radiation persists, creating hazardous zones

**The Threxul Rise**  
The Surge didn't harm the Threxul—it empowered them. Radiation-rich regions became breeding grounds for new broodclades. They spread aggressively, consuming resources and threatening all remaining civilizations.

**New Power Structure**
- **UTD (United Terran Directorate)** - Scattered remnants clinging to order
- **Hex-Corp** - Fragmented corporate state with secret tech vaults
- **Freebelt Coalition** - Guerrilla survivors resisting authority
- **Kaelorii Ascendancy** - Weakened but wise, seeking lost archives
- **Threxul Broodclades** - Expanding swarms, hostile to all
- **Interstellar Concordant** - Neutral trade havens keeping civilization alive
- **Ashinari Blades** - Elite cyber-samurai upholding ancient honor codes

**The Great Mystery**  
Three questions haunt every survivor:
1. **What caused The Surge?**
2. **Can it be reversed?**
3. **Is G'ejar-Vale real?**

---

## G'ejar-Vale - The Last Hope

### The Legend

G'ejar-Vale is a rumored sanctuary, whispered through corrupted data fragments and half-dead transmitters:
- **A hidden refuge** untouched by The Surge
- **A vault of ancient knowledge** that could reverse the catastrophe
- **A stronghold of survivors** rebuilding civilization
- **A trap** set by unknown forces

### The Theories

**The Sanctuary Theory**  
G'ejar-Vale is a hidden system protected by natural phenomena—perhaps a dense asteroid field or exotic stellar configuration that blocked The Surge's radiation.

**The Vault Theory**  
It's a pre-Surge megastructure designed to preserve knowledge, technology, and genetic samples. The last library of a dead civilization.

**The Trap Theory**  
G'ejar-Vale is the **source** of The Surge. Whatever entity or force created the catastrophe lures survivors to their doom.

**The Loop Theory**  
Reality itself is broken. G'ejar-Vale exists outside normal space-time, and reaching it means confronting the true nature of the universe post-Surge.

### The Search

Finding G'ejar-Vale requires:
- **Data fragments** scattered across dead systems
- **Coordinates** pieced together from salvaged archives
- **Star charts** showing safe routes through Surge zones
- **Understanding** of what caused The Surge
- **Preparation** for whatever truth awaits

**Your journey is to find it before the radiation claims you.**

## The Surge - Scientific Understanding

### What Is The Surge?

A galaxy-wide wave of exotic radiation that:
- Propagated faster than light
- Ignored conventional shielding
- Corrupted matter at the atomic level
- Created persistent radiation zones
- Warped local space-time

### Surge Radiation Properties

**Types of Radiation**:
- **Primary Surge** - Initial wave (mostly dissipated)
- **Static Radiation** - Persistent background in deep space
- **Surge Zones** - Concentrated pockets of extreme radiation
- **Corrupted Radiation** - Mutated forms with unpredictable effects

**Effects on Matter**:
- Electronics fail or malfunction
- Organic tissue mutates or decays
- Ship hulls degrade over time
- Atmospheres ionize and disperse
- Water molecules break down

**Effects on Life**:
- Rapid cellular breakdown in unshielded organisms
- Mutation in radiation-exposed survivors
- Corruption of AI and computer systems
- Psychological effects on long-term exposure
- Creation of "Corrupted" creatures

### Radiation Zones

**Dark Zones (Sun-Proximate)**  
Close to stars, solar radiation suppresses Surge effects:
- **Surge Radiation**: ZERO
- **Environmental Danger**: EXTREME (heat, flares)
- **Population**: HIGH (survivors cluster here)
- **Strategy**: Safe from Surge but crowded with scavengers

**Safe Zones (Mid-Range)**  
Optimal orbital distances with balanced radiation:
- **Surge Radiation**: LOW to MEDIUM
- **Environmental Danger**: MODERATE
- **Population**: MEDIUM
- **Strategy**: Best exploration zones

**Static Zones (Far from Sun)**  
Deep space where Surge radiation is unmitigated:
- **Surge Radiation**: EXTREME
- **Environmental Danger**: VERY HIGH
- **Population**: VERY LOW (abandoned)
- **Strategy**: Quick salvage runs, high risk/reward

**Surge Zones (Anomalies)**  
Concentrated pockets of extreme Surge energy:
- **Surge Radiation**: CRITICAL
- **Environmental Danger**: LETHAL
- **Population**: Corrupted entities only
- **Strategy**: Specialized equipment required, untouched loot

### Mitigation Strategies

**Natural Shielding**:
- **Iron-rich asteroids** - Reduce Surge by 50%
- **Planetary shadows** - Temporary protection
- **Gas giant magnetospheres** - Deflect some radiation
- **Dense nebulae** - Scatter radiation (but reduce visibility)

**Technological Shielding**:
- **Ship shields** - Reduce damage but drain power
- **Radiation meds** - Temporary immunity (limited supply)
- **Hull plating** - Passive resistance
- **Rad-scrubbers** - Remove contamination over time

**Tactical Approaches**:
- **Speed** - Less time exposed = less damage
- **Planning** - Route through safe zones when possible
- **Iron mining** - Collect shielding materials
- **Avoidance** - Some zones are simply too dangerous

# PART 2: CORE GAME MECHANICS

## Philosophy: D&D in Space

This is a **text-based, dice-driven roguelike**. Every action is determined by:
- **d20 + modifiers** vs. Difficulty Check (DC)
- **Critical Success (Nat 20)** - Exceptional outcomes, bonus rewards
- **Success (Meet/Beat DC)** - Action succeeds as intended
- **Failure (Below DC)** - Consequences apply
- **Critical Failure (Nat 1)** - Catastrophic results, severe penalties

---

## The RFE (Reference Frame Engine)

### Core Technology

The **Reference Frame Engine** enables near-instantaneous travel by collapsing space-time between two points. It's the only reason survival is possible in the post-Surge galaxy.

### Fuel System: Stellar Radiation

The RFE requires specific stellar radiation types to function:

| Star Type | Radiation Type | Fuel Value | Risk Level | Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **O-Type** (Blue Supergiants) | Extreme UV / X-Ray | Very High | Extreme | Rare |
| **B-Type** (Blue-White) | High UV | High | High | Uncommon |
| **A-Type** (White) | Moderate UV | Medium | Medium | Common |
| **F-Type** (Yellow-White) | Low UV | Low | Low | Common |
| **G-Type** (Yellow Sun-like) | Balanced | Medium | Low | Common |
| **K-Type** (Orange) | Infrared-Heavy | Low | Very Low | Common |
| **M-Type** (Red Dwarfs) | Deep Infrared | Very Low | Minimal | Very Common |

### Strategic Choices

**Route Planning**:
- High radiation stars = more fuel = more jumps (but more dangerous systems)
- Low radiation stars = safer exploration (but requires frequent refueling)
- Balance fuel efficiency vs. danger vs. time

**Refueling Mechanics**:
- Approach star within safe distance
- Deploy radiation collectors
- Time required based on star type and ship efficiency
- Risk of solar flares, heat damage, or hostile encounters

## Solar System Exploration

### System Generation (Seed-Based)

Each system has a unique **seed** that determines:
- Heliosphere size (solar system boundary)
- Star type and radiation output
- Number and type of POIs (Points of Interest)
- Environmental hazards
- Loot tables
- Encounter probabilities

**Deterministic Generation**: Same seed = same system (allows for sharing discoveries)

### Arrival & Scanning
